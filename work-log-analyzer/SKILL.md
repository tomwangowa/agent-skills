# Work Log Analyzer

## Purpose

This Skill analyzes work logs, journals, and development notes to help developers:
1. **Track project evolution** - Understand how implementations, features, or decisions evolved over time
2. **Manage TODOs** - Find pending, in-progress, and overdue tasks from logs
3. **Extract insights** - Discover patterns, decisions, and rationale behind implementations
4. **Answer questions** - Query logs with natural language to find specific information

The Skill helps developers:
- Quickly find information in lengthy work logs
- Track decision evolution and rationale
- Manage TODOs without external tools
- Generate status reports from logs
- Maintain project continuity

---

## Instructions

When the user provides a log file and asks a question (for example: "關於 SellerCheck 實作方案的演進", "我還有哪些 TODO 還沒完成？", "Lite Engagement 在何時才把 L10n 翻譯確定"), follow the steps below.

### Execution Steps

1. **Determine the skill base directory** from the skill invocation context (provided when the skill is loaded).

   **Important**: When using the aggregation script, always use the full absolute path:
   `<skill_base_directory>/scripts/aggregate_activities.sh`, not a relative path, since the
   current working directory may be the user's project directory.

2. **Identify the log file**
   - User provides explicit file path: use it directly
   - User says "my work log" or "my journal": ask for the file path
   - User pastes content directly: analyze the provided text

3. **Read and parse the log**
   - Read the file content using the available file reading tool
   - Parse the structure (dates, sections, TODOs, etc.)
   - Identify the format (Markdown, plain text, structured, unstructured)

4. **Understand the query**
   - **Activity queries** (NEW): "aggregate my activities", "show me today's work", "what did I do this week"
     - Use the `<skill_base_directory>/scripts/aggregate_activities.sh` helper script
     - Aggregates structured activity records from activity-logger
     - Supports filtering by date range, project, type, and tags
     - Formats output as readable work log or structured report
     - Query types:
       - Date range: today, yesterday, this-week, last-week, this-month, all
       - By project: specific project activities
       - By type: task_completed, bug_fixed, refactoring, research, documentation, review
       - By tag: activities with specific tags
     - Output modes:
       - by-date: Chronological daily report
       - by-project: Grouped by project
       - by-type: Grouped by activity type
       - json: Raw JSON for further processing

   - **Timeline queries**: "X 的演進", "how did X evolve", "X 的變化"
     - Extract all entries related to the topic
     - Sort chronologically
     - Summarize major milestones and decisions
     - Can now also query activity records for technical evolution

   - **TODO queries**: "未完成的 TODO", "過期的任務", "pending tasks"
     - Extract all TODO items
     - Categorize by status (pending, in-progress, completed)
     - Identify the current date from system context to accurately calculate overdue tasks (if system date unavailable, use the latest date found in the log file as reference)
     - Check due dates against current date and resolve relative dates (e.g., "yesterday", "last week")
     - Prioritize overdue items

   - **Decision queries**: "為什麼選擇 X", "X 的決策過程", "when was X decided"
     - Find relevant discussions and decisions
     - Extract rationale and context
     - Identify decision makers or influencing factors
     - Can now also search activity contexts for decision rationale

   - **Search queries**: General keyword search
     - Find all mentions of the topic
     - Provide context around each mention
     - Group related entries

4. **Analyze and synthesize**
   - Connect related entries across different dates
   - Identify patterns and trends
   - Highlight important context
   - Note any gaps or missing information

5. **Present findings**
   - Structure the answer clearly
   - Include dates and references
   - Quote relevant excerpts
   - Summarize key insights
   - Suggest follow-up questions if appropriate

### Output Requirements

Your response should be:

- **Clear and structured**: Use headings, bullet points, and quotes
- **Chronological when appropriate**: Timeline queries should show progression
- **Action-oriented for TODOs**: Show status, due dates, and priorities. Always state the reference date used for calculating overdue tasks (e.g., "分析日期: 2026-01-13")
- **Context-rich**: Include surrounding information to aid understanding
- **Referenced**: Cite dates or log sections for traceability

## Supported Log Formats

### Recommended Format (Structured Markdown)

```markdown
# 2026-01-13

## SellerCheck Implementation

- Decided to use PostgreSQL for seller verification data
- Considered Redis but concerned about persistence
- Next: prototype the schema

## TODOs

- [ ] TODO: Implement SellerCheck API (due: 2026-01-20) #high-priority
- [x] TODO: Fix L10n issues in Lite Engagement (completed: 2026-01-10)
- [ ] TODO: Code review for PR #123

## Decisions

**Decision**: Use PostgreSQL for SellerCheck
**Rationale**: Need ACID guarantees and complex queries
**Alternatives considered**: Redis, MongoDB
**Date**: 2026-01-13
```

### Also Supports

- **Plain text logs**: Less structured but still analyzable
- **Bullet point journals**: Simple daily logs
- **Unstructured notes**: Will extract information best-effort
- **Mixed formats**: Adapts to varying styles

### TODO Format Recognition

The Skill recognizes these TODO patterns:

```markdown
- [ ] TODO: Task description
- [x] TODO: Completed task
- TODO: Task without checkbox
- [ ] Task (due: YYYY-MM-DD)
- [ ] Task #priority-tag
- FIXME: Code fix needed
- HACK: Technical debt item
```

**Format Tolerance**: The Skill attempts to be lenient with common formatting variations:
- Checkboxes with missing spaces: `- []` or `- [X]` (though `- [ ]` and `- [x]` are preferred)
- Various completion markers: `[x]`, `[X]`, `[✓]`, `[✔]`
- In-progress markers: `[~]`, `[→]`, `[...]`
- Different TODO keywords: `TODO`, `FIXME`, `HACK`, `BUG`, `NOTE`

For best results, maintain consistent formatting throughout your logs.

---

## Constraints

- **File size**: Large files (>10,000 lines) may need to be split
- **Date parsing**: Works best with ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD) or clear date headers
- **TODO detection**: Most accurate with consistent formatting
- **Context**: Cannot access files or code references mentioned in logs (only the log content itself)
- **No write operations**: This Skill only reads and analyzes, does not modify logs

## Best Practices for Log Writing

To get the most from this Skill, consider these logging practices:

### 1. Use Consistent Date Headers
```markdown
# 2026-01-13
## Morning Session
```

### 2. Structure TODOs Clearly
```markdown
- [ ] TODO: Clear task description (due: 2026-01-20) #tag
```

### 3. Document Decisions Explicitly
```markdown
## Decision: Use PostgreSQL
**Why**: Need ACID guarantees
**Alternatives**: Redis, MongoDB
**Trade-offs**: Slower than Redis, but more reliable
```

### 4. Use Contextual Tags
```markdown
#SellerCheck #architecture #database
```

### 5. Link Related Entries
```markdown
See 2026-01-10 entry for initial discussion
```

### 6. Regular Updates
- Update TODOs when status changes
- Add completion dates for finished tasks
- Document rationale for decisions

---

## Advanced Queries

### Combining Criteria
- "過期的 high-priority TODOs"
- "Last week's decisions about authentication"

### Trend Analysis
- "How did the SellerCheck design change over time?"
- "What were the main concerns in January?"

### Cross-Topic Analysis
- "All decisions related to database choices"
- "TODOs blocked by external dependencies"

### Status Reports
- "Generate a weekly summary"
- "What's the current status of Project X?"

---

## Tips for Users

1. **Keep logs consistently**: Regular logging makes analysis more valuable
2. **Use clear dates**: ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD) works best
3. **Tag important entries**: Use hashtags for easy filtering
4. **Be specific in queries**: More context = better results
5. **Review TODO format**: Consistent format improves detection
6. **Include "why" not just "what"**: Decisions are more useful with rationale
7. **Update completion status**: Mark tasks as done to track progress
8. **Split large logs**: Consider monthly or quarterly files for better performance

---

## Integration with Other Skills

- **code-story-teller**: Combine code history with work log context
- **activity-logger**: Structured activity records for aggregation

---

## Limitations

- Cannot access external files referenced in logs
- No automatic log updating (read-only)
- Date parsing may fail on ambiguous formats
- Very unstructured logs may yield less precise results
- Cannot track TODOs across multiple files simultaneously (analyze one at a time)

---

## Output Language

- **Analysis and answers**: Traditional Chinese (matches user's CLAUDE.md preference)
- **Code snippets and technical terms**: English
- **Dates and times**: ISO format or as they appear in logs
- **Quotes from logs**: Original language preserved
