### Implementation Approach

**Option A: Extend spec-generator (Recommended)**
- Add template detection to spec-generator
- Automatically select template based on user's request
- Use Claude's understanding to choose the right format

**Option B: Separate Skills**
- Create dedicated skills (adr-generator, post-mortem-generator, etc.)
- More focused but higher maintenance cost

**Recommendation**: Start with Option A, add 3 most valuable templates:
1. ADR
2. Post-mortem
3. API Documentation

**Estimated Effort**:
- Infrastructure: 4-6 hours (template system)
- Per template: 1-2 hours (define structure and examples)
- Total for 3 templates: 10-12 hours

**Dependencies**: None - extends existing spec-generator (Claude-powered)

---

## Implementation Guidelines
