layout_variations:
  - type: "Title Slide"
    description: "Opening slide with asymmetric title placement"
    design: |
      Asymmetric vertical composition following Ma (間) principle - strategic emptiness.
      Main title positioned off-center: 35% from left edge, 30% from top (not centered - intentional asymmetry).
      Title uses heading typography: 44pt, primary color (#2D3436), font-weight 500, letter-spacing 0.03em.
      Title may be vertically oriented (optional) for dramatic Japanese aesthetic.
      Subtitle (if present): positioned with generous spacing (48px below or 80px to right of title).
      Subtitle: 18pt, text color (#1A1A1A) at 65% opacity, creating subtle hierarchy.
      Delicate accent element: thin vertical line (0.5px, accent_1 #D4A574) or small square (8px × 8px).
      Accent positioned asymmetrically to balance title weight - typically opposite side, 1/3 down from top.
      Brand element: very subtle, small wordmark or chop-style logo in corner, accent_2 color (#8B7355).
      Background: Off-white (#FAFAF8) with optional subtle texture (washi paper feel at 2% opacity).
      Negative space: 65-70% of canvas intentionally empty - Ma principle of meaningful emptiness.
      Overall atmosphere: Serene, contemplative, refined, quietly confident.
      Visual weight: Asymmetrically balanced - 60% on title/left, 40% in strategic emptiness.

  - type: "Content Slide"
    description: "Content with asymmetric text and image balance"
    design: |
      Asymmetric two-zone layout: text-heavy left, visual breathing room right.
      Section heading: 28pt, primary color (#2D3436), positioned 70px from top, 100px from left.
      Main content zone: Left 55%, starting 120px below heading.
      Text blocks: Body typography 18pt, text color (#1A1A1A), line-height 2.0 for vertical comfort.
      Paragraphs: Natural breaks with 32px spacing - rhythm follows content, not rigid grid.
      Right zone (45%): Intentional emptiness or single supporting visual element.
      If visual present: positioned with asymmetric offset (not centered) - 60% from top, occupying 80% of zone width.
      Visual surrounded by generous breathing room - Ma principle applied.
      Vertical accent line (1px, accent_1 #D4A574) may separate zones, but at 20% opacity for subtlety.
      Alternative: Use negative space alone as separator (no physical line) - pure Ma.
      Page number: Bottom-left corner (not center), 12pt, text color 40% opacity, 60px from edges.
      Background: Off-white (#FAFAF8) with optional subtle gradient (1-2% variation) mimicking natural lighting.
      Overall atmosphere: Calm, focused, naturally balanced, inviting contemplation.
      Visual weight: 60% on text content (left), 40% on visual/whitespace (right) - asymmetric harmony.
      Ma philosophy: Emptiness is not void but potential - negative space has presence and purpose.

  - type: "Data Slide"
    description: "Data visualization with natural spacing"
    design: |
      Data-focused layout with asymmetric chart positioning and generous breathing room.
      Chart title: 22pt, primary color (#2D3436), positioned asymmetrically - 25% from left, 60px from top.
      Main chart: Not centered - positioned 40% from left, 35% from top for natural balance.
      Chart size: 50% canvas height, 65% canvas width - leaving intentional emptiness.
      Chart style: Minimal lines (1px), using accent colors (#D4A574, #8B7355) for data series.
      Background of chart: Subtle off-white (#FFF9F0) or transparent - blending with canvas.
      Data labels: 14pt, monospace, text color (#1A1A1A), positioned with natural spacing (not rigid grid).
      Grid lines: Optional, if used - ultra-thin (0.3px), neutral warm gray at 15% opacity.
      Chart caption: Below and slightly offset from chart (not directly centered), 14pt, 70% opacity.
      Negative space: 50-55% of canvas left empty - surrounding chart with contemplative breathing room.
      Subtle accent: Small geometric marker (square or circle, 6px, accent_1) as visual anchor point.
      Background: Off-white (#FAFAF8) with very subtle texture gradient (top to bottom, 1% variation).
      Overall atmosphere: Calm data presentation, non-aggressive, contemplative analysis.
      Visual weight: 70% on chart and data, 30% in strategic negative space creating focus.
      Ma principle applied: Emptiness directs attention to data without visual noise.

  - type: "Summary Slide"
    description: "Summary with natural list flow"
    design: |
      Summary composition with natural vertical flow and asymmetric balance.
      Section heading: 28pt, primary color (#2D3436), positioned asymmetrically - 90px from top, 100px from left.
      Key points: Vertical list with natural spacing (not rigidly equal) - range 36-44px between items.
      List style: Minimal markers - small filled circles (5px, accent_1 #D4A574) or no markers (pure text list).
      Point text: 20pt, text color (#1A1A1A), font-weight 500 for emphasis without boldness.
      Each point may have optional sub-text: 14pt, 60% opacity, 12px below main text.
      Maximum 4-5 points - Japanese aesthetic of restraint and essential information only.
      Vertical accent element: Delicate line (1px, accent_2 #8B7355) or calligraphic stroke (SVG) on left.
      Accent line: Starts at first item, extends 60-70% down (not full height - asymmetric).
      Right side: Significant negative space (45-50% of canvas width) - Ma creating focus and calm.
      Optional closing element: Small abstract shape or traditional mon (family crest style) in lower right.
      Closing shape: 40px max size, accent_1 color (#D4A574), very subtle at 30% opacity.
      Background: Off-white (#FAFAF8) with gradient suggestion (vertical, 1% variation, warmer at bottom).
      Overall atmosphere: Contemplative conclusion, serene closure, invitation to reflection.
      Visual weight: 65% on left (point list), 35% in right negative space - asymmetric harmony.
      Ma philosophy: Silence after the list is as important as the content itself.
