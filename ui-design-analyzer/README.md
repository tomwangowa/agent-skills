# UI Design Analyzer

A Claude Code Skill for analyzing UI/UX design from screenshots using Claude's native multimodal capabilities.

## Overview

**UI Design Analyzer** provides comprehensive design analysis across 6 key dimensions:

1. 🎯 **Usability & UX** - Information hierarchy, user flow, clarity
2. 🎨 **Visual Design** - Color, typography, spacing, alignment
3. ♿ **Accessibility** - WCAG compliance, contrast ratios, touch targets
4. 📏 **Consistency** - Design system compliance, patterns
5. 📱 **Responsive** - Mobile/tablet/desktop considerations
6. 💡 **Improvements** - Actionable suggestions with specific values

**Key Advantage**: Uses Claude Code's native vision capabilities - no external tools required!

## Quick Start

### No Installation Required!

This skill works out of the box with Claude Code. No dependencies, no API keys, no setup!

### Usage

Simply ask Claude to analyze your UI screenshot:

```
Analyze this UI: /path/to/screenshot.png
```

```
Review this login page design: ~/Desktop/login-mockup.png
```

```
Is this mobile interface accessible?
Screenshot: /path/to/mobile-ui.png
```

```
Compare my implementation with Figma:
Implementation: /path/to/impl.png
Design: /path/to/figma-export.png
```

That's it! Claude will:
1. 👁️ Read and analyze the screenshot
2. 📊 Evaluate across 6 dimensions
3. 📝 Generate detailed report with specific recommendations
4. 💡 Provide actionable next steps

## What It Analyzes

### 1. Usability & Information Architecture

**Checks**:
- ✅ Visual hierarchy (most important elements stand out?)
- ✅ Navigation clarity (can users find their way?)
- ✅ Content scannability (F-pattern, visual flow)
- ✅ Action affordance (buttons look clickable?)
- ✅ User flow logic (next steps obvious?)

**Example Finding**:
```
⚠️ Primary CTA button not prominent enough
- Issue: "Submit" button uses same color as secondary actions
- Impact: Users may miss the primary action
- Fix: Use accent color (#3B82F6) for primary button,
      gray (#6B7280) for secondary
```

### 2. Visual Design & Aesthetics

**Checks**:
- ✅ Color harmony (complementary, analogous, monochromatic?)
- ✅ Typography (hierarchy, readability, pairing)
- ✅ Spacing (consistent 8px grid? proper breathing room?)
- ✅ Alignment (elements properly aligned?)
- ✅ Visual balance (weight distribution)
- ✅ White space usage

**Example Finding**:
```
🎨 Typography Hierarchy Issue
- Heading: 16px (too small for h1)
- Body: 14px (below recommended 16px for readability)
- Suggestion:
  - H1: 32px (2rem)
  - H2: 24px (1.5rem)
  - Body: 16px (1rem)
  - Caption: 14px (0.875rem)
```

### 3. Accessibility (WCAG 2.1)

**Checks**:
- ✅ Color contrast ratios (text, buttons, icons)
- ✅ Touch target sizes (minimum 44x44px for mobile)
- ✅ Font sizes (minimum 16px for body text)
- ✅ Visual indicators (not relying on color alone)
- ✅ Error message visibility
- ✅ Focus states (visible indicators)

**Example Finding**:
```
🔴 Accessibility Failure: Color Contrast
- Current: #999999 text on #FFFFFF background
- Contrast ratio: 2.8:1 ❌ (fails WCAG AA 4.5:1)
- Impact: Hard to read, especially for users with low vision
- Fix: Use #5F5F5F for 4.6:1 ratio ✅
      Or use #4A4A4A for 7.1:1 ratio ✅ (WCAG AAA)
```

### 4. Design System Compliance

**Checks**:
- ✅ Using defined color tokens vs hardcoded colors?
- ✅ Spacing from design system (4, 8, 16, 24, 32px)?
- ✅ Component variants consistent?
- ✅ Icon set cohesive?

**Example Finding**:
```
⚠️ Hardcoded spacing detected
- Card padding: 14px (non-standard)
- Button padding: 10px 18px (non-standard)
- Suggestion: Use design tokens:
  - Card: p-4 (16px) or p-6 (24px)
  - Button: px-4 py-2 (16px 8px)
```

### 5. Mobile/Responsive Considerations

**Checks** (for mobile UIs):
- ✅ Single column layout for small screens?
- ✅ Touch-friendly tap targets?
- ✅ Thumb-zone optimization?
- ✅ Horizontal scroll avoided?
- ✅ Text readable without zoom?

**Example Finding**:
```
🟡 Mobile UX Issue
- Touch targets too small: 32x32px (below 44x44px minimum)
- Form inputs too close together: 8px gap (recommend 16px+)
- Suggestion: Increase button height to 44px, spacing to 16px
```

### 6. Improvement Suggestions

**Provides**:
- 🎯 Quick wins (easy, high impact)
- 🔄 Important improvements (medium effort)
- 🚀 Long-term enhancements (nice-to-have)

## Features

## Advantages

| Aspect | Manual Review | ui-design-analyzer |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Setup** | Designer expertise | None - works immediately |
| **Speed** | 15-30 min per screen | 1-2 minutes |
| **Consistency** | Varies by reviewer | Standardized framework |
| **Accessibility** | Often overlooked | Visual accessibility checked (WCAG contrast, sizes) |
| **Metrics** | Subjective | Estimated metrics (approximate values) |

## Typical Output

- **Analysis time**: 1-2 minutes per screenshot
- **Report length**: 150-300 lines (comprehensive)
- **Issues found**: Typically 5-15 per screen
- **Success rate**: High (based on established UX principles)

## Limitations

- Static screenshots only (not interactive prototypes)
- Color detection is approximate (verify hex codes manually)
- Cannot test actual user behavior (use usability testing for that)
- Best for web/mobile UI (less suitable for specialized UI like games, AR)
- Analysis based on general principles (may not fit every brand/context)

## Integration with Other Skills

### Complete Design-to-Code Workflow

```
1. Designer creates mockup
2. ui-design-analyzer reviews design ← Catch issues early
3. spec-generator creates implementation spec
4. Developers implement
5. ui-design-analyzer checks implementation ← Verify match
6. code-review-gemini reviews code
7. Ship with confidence!
```

### With spec-generator

```
You: Analyze this UI, then generate an implementation spec

Claude:
1. Analyzes screenshot
2. Identifies requirements from UI
3. Generates complete spec including noted issues

Result: Spec that addresses design problems from the start
```

## Common Questions

### Q: Can it detect specific pixel values?

**A**: Claude can detect approximate sizes and spacing. For pixel-perfect validation, measurements are estimates. Best used for:
- Identifying obvious inconsistencies
- Checking relative proportions
- Verifying general adherence to design

### Q: Can it suggest code to implement fixes?

**A**: Yes! Claude can generate:
- CSS/Tailwind classes for spacing and colors
- Hex codes for better color contrast
- Component structure suggestions
- Design token definitions

### Q: Can it analyze dark mode designs?

**A**: Absolutely! Just mention it:
```
Analyze this dark mode UI for contrast and readability
```

### Q: Can it compare before and after redesigns?

**A**: Yes! Provide both screenshots:
```
Compare these designs and tell me which UX is better:
Before: ~/before.png
After: ~/after.png
```
